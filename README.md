# Vote Funny (meanLab)

I decided to produce a website where fans can upload and vote on their favorite Comedy Central show to prove which one is the funniest of them all.

In this applications fans of the popular comedy network, Comedy Central can sign in via Facebook, Github, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and or Email via Auth0. Once logged in they have full C.R.U.D. functionality to update, edit, create, and delete shows. They will also have the ability to upvote their favorite shows, and even play a YouTube video clip of each show. If the fans really enjoy the show they can click on the show title and be linked directly to the Comedy Central (https://cc.com) landing page for each respective show.
